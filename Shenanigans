     Shenanigan handles dispute resolution in the mobile app. Disputes can arise from mistakes, particle crowd disapproval, an iOn playing unfairly, and other unforeseen issues. In the resolutions panel, $PRTCLE holders can vote on the correct outcome. Each dispute has the livestream available to watch, the options to choose from the challenge, and a voting mechanism for $PRTCLE holders. This replaces a centralized team of people making decisions. Resolution votes cannot be bought and must be earned through SourceCred. By using the minimum value between an account's $PRCTLE balance and Cred score, we can ensure only tokens earned count toward the resolution vote. This ensures votes cannot be bought, then dumped after, in order to swing the vote. Also voting power will be concentrated within the people who use the app. By using the minimum value between an account's $PRCTLE balance and Cred score, we can ensure only tokens' earned count towards the resolution vote. use the product, while retaining a low barrier to entry. SourceCred also provides Sybil resistance as accounts who have taken part in the prediction market are not allowed to vote on the accompanying resolution. Lastly, to combat Cred whales, Shenanigan implements a quadratic voting model to even out the playing field in voting power. Early adopters with abnormally large amounts of Cred will not have power to swing the vote one way.
